Questions on Binary Tree :

1. Print the left view of a binary tree.

2.Print the deepest right leaf node of a binary tree

3. print the tree in a spiral form (given is the pointer to the root node)
	     1
	  2     3
	4   5 6   7

	op:
	1
	3 2
	4 5 6 7
first try with the simple logic O(n^2) where n is the number of nodes in the given tree.
then try to optimize it to do it in O(n).


Questions on Linked List :

4. Add the two numbers represented by two linked lists respectively input : the heads of the both the linked list handle all the edge cases
e.g. 1->2->3->4->null
       5->6->7->null 
  4321
+  765
 -----
  5086
output : 6->8->0->5->null

5.Given a pointer to a node of the linked list, delete that node.
input : pointer to the node to be deleted
1->2->3->4->null
lets say pointer to 2 was given 
output : 1->3->4->null

6. Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray(not subsequence)
input : [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
--> 4 + (-1) + (-2) + 1 + 5
output : 7 
Input:  [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1]
--->[3, 4, 5]
ouput : 12

Questions on Subsequence & Subarray :

7. Maximum sum increasing subsequence
subsequence - 'xoriantsystems' -- 'xoatysts' is a subsequence of the parent string (need not to be contiguous)
return the sum of the maximum sum increasing subsequence such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted non-decreasing order.
Input: length of the array, array elements
Input: [1, 104, 2, 3, 100, 4, 6]
--> [1, 2, 3 ,100]
Output: 106

8.Given two strings of length m and n respectively find the length of longest
common subsequence 
input : xoriantsolutions , xorandornot
--> xoranot
ouput : 7

9.You are given only 5 zeros, apply any mathematical operator(s) any number of times make the result 120
